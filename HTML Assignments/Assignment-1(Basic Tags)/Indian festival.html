<h3>Diwali marks the start of the Hindu New Yesr and lasts for five days. <br>The exact date changes yearly as it follows the Hindu calender, but<br> Diwali generally occurs between October and November. It's known <br>as the Hindu Festival of Lights as people decorate their homes with<br> lights as 'diyas',or oil kights, because they's said to help the goddess <br>of wealth find her way to peoples' homes. People will often draw <br>'rangoli', patterns amde of coloured powders and flowers, on the<br> floor at the entrance to their homes as a welcoming to the gods.</ul></h3>

<h3>When most Westerners think of an Indian festival, they think of Holi.<br> It's one of the most celebrated festivals in the country and is famous <br>for the vibrant coloured powders thrown through the streets. Red <br>symbolises love and fertility; blue represents Krishna, a Hindu God;<br> green represents new beginnings; and yellow represents turmeric, a<br> powder native to India.</h3>
<li><u><h2>Dussehra</h2></u></li>

<h3>Another Hindu festival, Dussehra celenbrates the victory of Rama over <br>the demon king Ravana, who carried off Lord Rama's wife Sita. This was, <br>it seems, frowned upon, but dont's worry-good triumphed over evil<br> and now it's time to party. Celebrations includes bonfires, fireworls<br> and burning effigies of the demon king Ravana, while red spots <br>are also painted on people's foreheads. This festival usually occurs in October.</h3>
<li><u><h2>Ganesh Chaturthi Festival</h2></u></li>

<h3>Ganesha is the god of new beginnings,  success and wisdom and can be <br>quite easily idenitified thanks to his elephant head. Of all the gods that<br> make up the Hindu religion, he's one of the most well-known, and<br> the Ganesh Chaturthi Festival is held in his honour to celebrate his <br>birth.Usually held in August/September, the festival lasts for 11<br> days and sees huge statues built, displayed and worlshipped in both homes <br>and public areas. On the final day, the statues are paraded<br> through the streets, with thoudsnds  of followers dancing and <br>singing alongside, before finally being immersed in the ocean.</h3>
<li><u><h2>Krishn Janmashtami</h2></u></li>

<h3>This festival commemorates the birth of Lord  Krishna, who os revered <br>for his positive attitude towards life and his ability to smile through life<br> and death, and victory and defeat. The festival is usually<br> held in late August or early September, depending on the year, and the <br>highlight is the 'Dahi Handi'.Clay pots containing money, butter and <br>curd are strung up from building and people compete to reach the pots by forming<br> a human pyramid and clambering to the top. There's a<br> perfectly reasonable explanation for this bizarre spectacle- Lord Krishna<br> absolutely loved butter and curd, and would try to take it from homes,<br> so the villagers would hang it out of his reach. The story goes that he<br> roped his friends into helping him climb up and reach it.</h3>
<li><u><h2>Eid-ul-Fitr</h2></u></li>

<h3>Eid-ul-Fitr marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and is one of <br>the most important Islamic festivals. To celebrate, Muslims attend communal <br>prayers, decorate their homes and exchange food and gifts with friends.<br> There's also a charity donatiion of rice from wealthy families<br> to the needy. One of the best places to see the celebrations is at <br>Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, which was built in the mid-17th century.</h3>
